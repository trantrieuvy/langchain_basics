# LangChain for LLM Application Development
I took this course on DeepLearning.AI and followed some of the provided code, while also creating my own examples. I also updated several dependencies to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of LangChain.

## Topics Covered
- **Models, Prompts, and Parsers:** Learn how to call LLMs, craft prompts, and parse responses.
- **Memories for LLMs:** Manage conversation history and context limitations.
- **Chains:** Build sequences of operations using LangChain.
- **Question Answering over Documents:** Apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use-case-specific needs.
- **Agents:** Explore LLMs as reasoning agents for advanced applications.
